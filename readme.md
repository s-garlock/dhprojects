# About Me

### Samantha Garlock

I'm in my third, and hopefully final, year of an MLIS from the iSchool, and also an Applied Master's from the School of Human Ecology. I was born in Boston, lived in North Carolina for a long time and NYC briefly, and have been in Madison for... 6 years? Since coming back to grad school, I've worked in several libraries across campus: College Library, Special Collections, and the Oral History Project. I actually run the [instagram] (https://www.instagram.com/uwmadspec/) for Special Collections-- check it out and follow us! Hmm, what else... I have a background in Gender and Women's Studies... and three very needy cats.
